## What is AdStudio?

**AdStudio** is an AI-powered ad creation platform that turns three simple inputs — a **text prompt**, a **model image**, and a **product image** — into a polished ad image or short video in minutes.

```
Prompt  +  Model Image  +  Product Image  →  AI Ad Image / Short Ad Video
```

No design skills. No photoshoot. No video editor. Just describe your idea and AdStudio handles:

- 📝 **Script** — AI-written copy and voiceover narration tailored to your concept
- 🎭 **Visual Composition** — Model + product placed into a fully generated scene
- 🔊 **Voiceover** — Natural-sounding narration with music
- 🎬 **Final Edit** — Ready-to-publish image or video in every platform format

---

## Core Formula

AdStudio is built around three core inputs that drive everything:

### Input 1 — Text Prompt
Describe your ad in plain language. AdStudio's LLM parses the prompt to extract:
- Product category and key benefit
- Tone of voice (luxury, playful, urgent, minimal, etc.)
- Target audience and demographic
- Desired call-to-action (CTA)
- Scene mood, setting, and visual style
- Brand colour or aesthetic hints

**Example prompt:**
> *"Premium skincare serum for women aged 25–40, dewy glowing skin, soft morning light, pastel tones, CTA: Shop Now"*

---

### Input 2 — Model Image
Upload any photo of a person, character, or avatar. AdStudio:
- Segments and extracts the subject from the background
- Adapts pose and lighting to match the generated scene
- Optionally applies clothing/style transfer to match the ad aesthetic
- Falls back to a curated stock model library if no image is provided

---

### Input 3 — Product Image
Upload your product photo (raw, packaged, or on white). AdStudio:
- Removes the background automatically
- Infers 3D surface geometry for realistic shadow/reflection synthesis
- Preserves labels, logos, and textures exactly as uploaded
- Places the product naturally into the composed scene with correct perspective

---

### Output — Ad Image or Short Ad Video

| Output Type | Format | Resolution | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static Ad Image | PNG / JPEG / WebP | Up to 4K | — |
| Layered Source File | PSD | Up to 4K | — |
| Short Ad Video | MP4 / MOV | Up to 1080p | 5–30 seconds |

Every run generates 3–5 visual variants for you to choose from.

---

## Generation Pipeline

AdStudio processes your three inputs through a 5-stage AI pipeline:

### Stage 1 — Intent Parsing
The text prompt is processed by a large language model to produce a structured **creative brief** — a JSON object defining tone, audience, scene description, copy angle, and CTA. This brief drives all downstream generation.

### Stage 2 — Asset Preparation
- **Model image**: subject segmentation, pose normalisation, lighting estimation
- **Product image**: background removal, surface normal extraction, label/logo preservation
- Both assets are encoded and passed as conditioning inputs to the visual model

### Stage 3 — Scene Composition
A conditioned image diffusion model generates the full ad scene — background environment, lighting, depth of field, shadows, and reflections — with the model and product composited in naturally. Multiple variants are generated in parallel.

### Stage 4 — Copy & Voiceover (Video mode)
For video output, an LLM generates a short ad script (hook → body → CTA). Text-to-speech produces a natural voiceover. Captions are auto-timed and styled. Background music is selected or generated to match the mood.

### Stage 5 — Export & Delivery
Final assets are transcoded into all requested aspect ratios and resolutions. Exports include source files, platform-spec video files, and a copy bundle (headline + caption + hashtags) for each platform.

## Use Cases

### D2C / E-Commerce Brand — Product Launch & Sales
A skincare brand launches a new serum. They upload the bottle, a lifestyle model photo, and type:
> *"Luxury skincare, dewy skin, morning routine feel, women 25–40, CTA: Shop Now"*

AdStudio generates 5 image ad variants and a 15-second Reel — all ready to push to Meta Ads within minutes. No agency. No photoshoot. No designer.

**Key benefits:** Launch-day speed, multi-SKU at scale, zero creative team dependency.

---

### Digital Marketing Agency — Client Deliverables at Scale
An agency managing 30 brand clients uses AdStudio to generate first-draft creatives instantly. Each client has a saved brand kit. A brief becomes 20 ad variants (image + video) in under an hour — reducing creative production time by over 80%. Designers focus only on edge-case refinements.

**Key benefits:** Brand kit per client, bulk generation, approval workflow, shareable review links.

---

### Performance Marketer — A/B Testing & Creative Refresh
A performance marketer running paid social needs 10 fresh creative variants weekly to combat ad fatigue. AdStudio lets them swap hooks, change model expressions, and test different CTAs without waiting on design resources — keeping CPMs low and CTR healthy.

**Key benefits:** Weekly creative refresh, zero design dependency, hook A/B testing at speed.

---

### Fashion & Beauty Creator — Brand Collaborations
A beauty influencer creates sponsored content for a cosmetics brand. They upload a selfie as the model image, add the product, write a casual brief, and get a UGC-style ad that looks authentic — without a full production shoot.

**Key benefits:** Self-image as model, UGC aesthetic output, brand collab deliverables in hours.

---

### Startup / Solo Founder — Zero Budget Launch
A solo founder building a food product has no marketing budget for a photoshoot or agency. They photograph their product with a phone, pick a stock model, write a quick brief, and launch a polished Instagram campaign the same day.

**Key benefits:** Zero photoshoot cost, same-day launch capability, stock model fallback library.

---

### Marketplace Seller — Listing Images at Scale
A Meesho or Amazon seller with 100+ products needs lifestyle images for every SKU. AdStudio auto-generates a lifestyle scene for each product upload in bulk — dramatically improving listing conversion rates without a single studio booking.

**Key benefits:** Bulk product processing, listing-ready images, regional scene presets.

---

### App & SaaS Marketing — User Acquisition Ads
A mobile app team needs short demo videos for user acquisition campaigns. They use AdStudio to create screen-based ads with a model interacting with the app, a value-prop voiceover, and platform-spec video exports for Google UAC, Apple Search Ads, and Meta.

**Key benefits:** App screenshot integration, UAC / ASA format export, demo-style video ads.

---

### Multilingual & Regional Campaigns — Localisation at Scale
A FMCG brand running campaigns across India, UAE, and UK needs the same ad localised with different model faces, backgrounds, languages, and cultural cues. AdStudio generates locale-specific variants from a single master prompt by swapping the model image and adjusting the scene brief per region.

**Key benefits:** Locale-specific scene presets, copy in 20+ languages, model swap per region.

---

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import repository in [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy with one click

```bash
vercel deploy
```

### Deploy to Other Platforms

**Docker:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### API Key Issues
- Verify all API keys in `.env.local` are correct
- Check API quotas and billing status
- Ensure API keys have proper permissions

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```
